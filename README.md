#  IMDB Movie Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive data analytics case study based on IMDB movie data. The project focuses on identifying the key factors that influence the success of a movie, where success is defined by a **high IMDB rating**. This analysis is especially valuable for **producers, directors, marketers, and investors** who seek insights to guide decision-making in the film industry.

##  Problem Statement

> **"What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?"**

Understanding the key attributes that contribute to higher IMDB ratings can help filmmakers make informed creative and financial decisions. This project involves performing detailed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical investigations using Excel.

##  Project Workflow

### 1️. Data Cleaning

The initial phase involves preprocessing the dataset to make it analysis-ready:

- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicate records
- Converting data types where required
- Extracting and formatting columns (e.g., splitting genres or languages)
- Feature engineering for derived insights (e.g., profit margin)

---

### 2️. Data Analysis

This phase involves uncovering relationships between movie characteristics and their success metrics. The analysis is divided into five parts:

---

##  A. Movie Genre Analysis

**Objective**: Understand how movie genres relate to IMDB ratings.

**Tasks**:
- Identify the most common movie genres.
- For each genre, calculate:
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode
  - Range
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation

**Tools**:
- `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGE`, `MEDIAN`, `MODE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `VAR`, `STDEV`

**Outcome**:
Gain insights into which genres consistently perform well in terms of ratings.

---

##  B. Movie Duration Analysis

**Objective**: Explore the relationship between movie duration and IMDB score.

**Tasks**:
- Compute summary statistics (mean, median, SD) for movie durations.
- Create a scatter plot of duration vs. IMDB score.
- Add a trendline to interpret the direction and strength of correlation.

**Tools**:
- `AVERAGE`, `MEDIAN`, `STDEV`, `SCATTER PLOT`, `TRENDLINE`

**Outcome**:
Identify if longer (or shorter) movies tend to perform better.

---

##  C. Language Analysis

**Objective**: Determine the most common languages and their impact on ratings.

**Tasks**:
- Count movies by language.
- For each language, calculate:
  - Mean IMDB Score
  - Median IMDB Score
  - Standard Deviation

**Tools**:
- `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGE`, `MEDIAN`, `STDEV`

**Outcome**:
Understand if the language of a movie influences its reception.

---

##  D. Director Analysis

**Objective**: Investigate how directors influence movie success.

**Tasks**:
- Calculate average IMDB rating per director.
- Use `PERCENTILE` to identify top-performing directors.
- Compare top directors against overall score distribution.

**Tools**:
- `AVERAGEIF`, `PERCENTILE`, `SORT`, `RANK`

**Outcome**:
Spotlight directors with a consistent track record of high-rated films.

---

##  E. Budget Analysis

**Objective**: Examine the link between production budgets and financial outcomes.

**Tasks**:
- Compute correlation between budget and gross earnings.
- Calculate profit margin (`Gross - Budget`).
- Identify movies with the highest margins.

**Tools**:
- `CORREL`, `MAX`, `GROSS - BUDGET`

**Outcome**:
Determine how financial investment correlates with movie success.

##  Root Cause Analysis: The Five Whys

Example Insight:
> Movies with higher budgets tend to have higher ratings.

**Five Whys Technique**:
1. **Why?** They afford better production quality.  
2. **Why?** Better visuals and sound enhance experience.  
3. **Why?** Enhanced experience increases viewer satisfaction.  
4. **Why?** Satisfied viewers rate movies higher.  
5. **Why?** Higher ratings drive more viewership and success.
